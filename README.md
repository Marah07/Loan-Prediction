# Loan-Prediction

Loan prediction is a critical task in the banking and financial industry, where the goal is to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants and predict whether they are likely to repay the loan or default on their payments. The business understanding part of loan prediction involves gaining a clear understanding of the problem, its significance, and the specific objectives of the prediction model. The primary objective of loan prediction is to minimize the risk of default and financial losses for the lending institution. By accurately assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants, the bank can make informed decisions about approving or rejecting loan applications. This process helps maintain a healthy loan portfolio, minimize defaults, and maximize profitability. To build an effective loan prediction model, it is essential to have access to historical loan data that includes information about borrowers, their financial attributes, loan terms, and whether they have repaid the loan or defaulted in the past. The availability and quality of data play a crucial role in the accuracy and reliability of the prediction model. The target variable in loan prediction is typically binary, indicating whether a borrower will default (1) or not (0) on their loan repayment. This variable is used to train the prediction model, making it capable of classifying new loan applications into default or non-default categories.
In this project I followed the CRISP-DM process.
